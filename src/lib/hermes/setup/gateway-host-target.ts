/**
 * Decides, **from the address alone**, whether we can handle the host of an already registered gateway.
 *
 * Updating is an action that must run commands on the host, so we first have to know which host. All we
 * know is the gateway record's `baseUrl`, and it splits three ways.
 *
 *   - loopback      — the same host DeskRPG runs on. Handled by the local executor.
 *   - ssh-registered — an address made by `registerSshTransport`. The host id is in the registry.
 *   - anything else — somewhere we can't run commands (e.g. `host.docker.internal` as seen
 *                  from a container, or a remote Hermes run by someone else).
 *
 * Pure function — looks at no files or network. Actually extracting the ssh host id requires
 * reading the registry, so `transport.ts` does that.
