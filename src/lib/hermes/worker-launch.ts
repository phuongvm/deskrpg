/**
 * Whether Hermes can start kanban workers from a gateway — the plugin's `kanban.worker_launch` report.
 *
 * Hermes starts a worker with `$HERMES_BIN` when it is set, and otherwise as `<gateway python> -m hermes_cli.main`
 * without the gateway's PYTHONPATH. On the upstream PM runtime that command cannot import Hermes, so every worker
 * exits at once and its card is given up — a board that silently never runs anything. The fix is one environment
 * variable on the gateway; this module turns the report into a warning and the command that sets it on that host.
 *
 * Pure functions (also goes into the browser bundle — does not pull in `@/db`).
