 * Gateway-level reachability probe.
 *
 * In Hermes, auth applies at profile scope (named profiles fail closed and require their own
 * API_SERVER_KEY), so all that can be checked at the gateway level is
 * "is a Hermes API Server up at this address". Whether the token is right is checked by the profile
 * test (validateHermesProfile) — not duplicated here.
 *
 * **`/health` alone is not enough.** That endpoint is unauthenticated, and the Hermes dashboard
 * also returns 200. The dashboard is an SPA that returns 200 + HTML for any path via catch-all, so
 * status codes alone can't distinguish it from the real API Server — confirmed by measurement:
 *
 *     API Server (8643)  /health 200 · /v1/models 401 application/json
 *     dashboard  (9119)  /health 200 · /v1/models 200 text/html
 *
 * So we poke `/v1/models` once more and decide by **whether the content-type is JSON**.
 * No token needed — the real API Server rejects unauthenticated requests with JSON.
