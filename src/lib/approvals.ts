/**
 * Pre-execution approval gate — sets a card to `blocked` and creates an approval record alongside it.
 *
 * Why `blocked`: a card created with `initial_status="blocked"` in Hermes is **sticky**,
 * so `recompute_ready` won't promote it — only `unblock_task` releases it (confirmed
 * 2026-09-21). `triage` can't be used as a holding state because the gateway
 * auto-decomposes it every tick.
 *
 * Why there's no source field on the Hermes card: whether approval is needed is
 * decided by **whether it went through this path**. Cards made by cron, swarm, or a
 * worker don't go through here, so they run unmarked as-is.
