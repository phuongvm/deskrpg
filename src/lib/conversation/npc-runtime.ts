/**
 * Cuts the turn off once the signal (assistant delta / tool progress) stalls this long.
 *
 * This is new behavior, not a port. `turnTimeoutMs` at meeting-broker.js:72 was a dead setting
 * read nowhere but its own initializer, and the old broker never actually timed out a turn —
 * a stalled agent held the meeting hostage forever. Only the value (180s) was carried over
 * from that dead setting.
 *
 * There's a cost: the idle timer only resets on onDelta/onToolProgress, but the old gateway
 * adapter never called onToolProgress and only forwarded onDelta. So an NPC that quietly runs
 * a tool for more than 3 minutes — a turn that would have finished before — now gets cut off
 * and reported as an error. The spec's "reset the idle timer on tool.progress" is only
 * implemented on the current Hermes path.

 *
 * Why 3: at 1, a single transient network error kills the meeting; set it too high and the
