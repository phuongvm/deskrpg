/**
 * The report queue — extracts "who should come and speak" from office room notices.
 *
 * The actor is **the viewing browser**, not the server. `npc:call` is a socket handler that determines its target
 * with `targetPlayerId: socket.id` (`src/server/npc-coordination.ts`), so automation events have no one
 * to walk to. So the browser that received the notice fires the existing call itself — if nobody is
 * connected, the move is skipped and only the notice stays in the room, which is the right behavior.
 *
 * Only pure functions here. This file goes into the client bundle, so it does not use `node:*` or `@/db`.
