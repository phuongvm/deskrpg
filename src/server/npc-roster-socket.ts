/**
 * Clocks one NPC in or out.
 *
 * It's a socket rather than REST because the meeting state lives only in the socket handler's closure
 * (`activeBrokers`) — routes can't see it. Removing a participant from the map mid-meeting leaves the
 * in-progress turn with nowhere to go, so only clocking out is blocked (clocking in is always allowed).
 *
 * The authority on "is this NPC in a meeting" is **the broker's `config.participants`**. A discussion does not
 * take all of the channel's NPCs — only the subset `start-discussion` filtered with `selectedNpcIds`
 * become participants (the `selectedNpcIds` filter in the `meeting:start-discussion` handler,
 * meeting-discussion.ts). So a channel-level check
 * (`activeBrokers.has(channelId)`) would also lock NPCs that weren't invited to the meeting.
 *
 * The participants in `meetingRooms` are **human socket.ids** and must not be used here.
 * Looking up by NPC id is always false, and conversely checking "is it non-empty" lets one person with the
 * meeting panel open block the owner's clock-out indefinitely (the room is never deleted).
