/**
 * Automation event poller (T5, R23·R24·E6·E7).
 *
 * For each bound channel, periodically reads the plugin's change list (`/deskrpg/events?board=…&cursor=…`) and
 * hands it to the event sink `ingest()`. The browser never calls Hermes directly (R26) — this poller is the
 * only thing inside the server that pulls events.
 *
 * - The baseline token lives per channel (+gateway) in `channel_kanban_boards.event_cursor`.
 *   Without a token (first connection, gateway swap) it calls without a cursor, takes only the "now" token and
 *   **does not replay the past** (R23). If the plugin returns 400 `unknown_cursor`, it restarts the same way
 *   (E7).
 * - Interval: short when the channel has connected sockets (default 5s), long otherwise (default 60s). Right
 *   after an on-screen action, `pollNow(channelId)` runs once immediately (R24).
 * - Failures are not thrown but recorded in `last_error`. On success it clears it to null and stamps
 *   `last_polled_at` (E6).
 * - A failed board ensure (`board_name_synced_at` never stamped) is retried every tick — once the plugin is
 *   installed, the next tick creates the board (R5). If name sync failed after a channel rename
 *   (`board_name_synced_at` earlier than the channel's `updated_at`), a tick that passes the gate re-syncs it
 *   once (R2).
 * - Every timer is `unref()` — they don't hold the test runner or CLI exit.
 *
 * The pure single tick (`pollChannelOnce`) is kept separate from the timer registry (`createAutomationPoller`).
 * Tests call the former directly; the server uses the process-global instance of the latter.
